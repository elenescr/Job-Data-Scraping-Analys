Technical Architecture (Overview) Project Layers Scraper Layer

Static Scraper: RemoteOK Selenium Scrapers: Remotive, Jobspresso Scrapy Spider: RemoteOK Managed using Strategy Pattern via run_scraper.py Pipeline

Collected jobs go through clean_and_validate_jobs() Jobs are saved in SQLite via database.py Uses a unified job model Export and Reporting

Exports to CSV, JSON, Excel Charts and HTML report generated using matplotlib and seaborn Concurrency

Parallel scraping using ThreadPoolExecutor Patterns Used

Strategy Pattern: select scraper by name Factory Pattern: ScraperFactory Observer Pattern (Optional): Logging and output tracking Testing

test_processors.py ensures data cleaning logic Easily extensible to test scraper outputs Config & Extensibility Uses settings.yaml to define scraper sources and limits Easily extensible by adding new scraper classes to the strategy map
